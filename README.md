CLIVISALBUM
# clivisalbum

Just a small bash script to fetch the song being played on ncmpcpp, print an ASCII version of its album art, as well as get the colour pallete from it and generating a colour configuration for cli-visualizer.

TO DO: Somehow make cli-visualizer automatically load the new colour config whenever an album changes.
TO DO: Using glyrc, do something regarding bios.
